# Ground Branch Hunteering

CURRENT VERSION: V1
COMPATIBLE WITH: Ground Branch CTE v1032

This mod recreates the real life Hunteering Airsoft game play created by 6mm Hunters into Ground Branch.

Make no mistake. This is more of a horror game then anything else you've played in Ground Branch.
You will be looking constantly over your shoulder thinking you are being watched until finally you get shot.

The premise of the gameplay is to retrieve one laptop in the game area (of 5 possible locations) and extract with it at the end of the round.
You have extremely limited ammo (10 sniper rifle shots and one pistol magazine) and are fully ghillied up, as are your adversaries.

- You can play by yourself against bots (suggest 1 or 2, but try 8 for a feeling of helplessness as shots are fired all around you)
- You can play against bots and players (again, suggest 1, max 2 bots)
- You can team up with another player (up to two teams) and still add bots

# DISCLAIMER WARNING
- Ground Branch is still on Early Access and often getting updated and this mod may no longer work. Currently tested for version 1032.
- The author of the mod often get startled pretty badly when I get unknowingly shot by a bot OR player, so if a surprise loud headshot is not your thing maybe try a different mod :)
- This mod can break at any time or potentially break your game (unlikely) which would require a reinstall.
- The author of the mod take no responsibility if your game breaks due to installing this mod (correctly or incorrectly).
- The author of the mod can't confirm this mod will be compatible with your current Ground Branch version.
- It's not Ground Branch devs responsibility to ensure this mod works so don't annoy them on discord if something is broken with the mod.

NOTE: If you don't know if you are putting the files in the right place just check the path of the files in the zip and match them to the Ground Branch installation folder path. Remember rushing things just makes things work worse or not at all :)


# HOW TO PLAY

- Start game as normal. You can select Lone Wolf or create a server option.
- Adjust options as you wish, select map and click play.
- Once you enter the loadout space your loadout will be automatically selected. At the moment no loadout is restricted but for the best gameplay stick to the automatically selected loadout.

Game options:
- Bot Count (you can have up to 8 bots)
- Display search locations (the default is for all search locations to show and you have to find the correct where the bot is. If you want to limit the gameplay for a shorter play change to a different option)
- Enemy Experience (how hard the bots are)
- Exfil window in minutes (the amount of time you have from the end of the round to exfil)
- Time limit (from testing 20 minutes seems to be the sweet spot)
- Laptop hacking in seconds (how long it will take you to get the laptop - all laptops are in very visible locations)
- Laptop proximity alert (if enabled your watch will warn you when you are close to the laptop)
- Player team up (if enabled it will change the random player respawns to fixed - up to two teams can play together against the bots - the bots don't team up)
